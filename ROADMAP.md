# Roadmap

## P1
- [ ] Update/Decide upon basic types, focus on usability
    - Timestamps probably better than BitArray but maybe less useable? Possible to have both?
    - How to best preserve session -> trial -> event hierarchy?
- [ ] Updates for v0.5/6
    - SubArrays instead of views
- [ ] Tests for Travis

## P2
- [ ] Decide on plotting backend or use plotly
- [ ] Example notebook with data (or fake data) demonstrating use
